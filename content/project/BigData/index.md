Imagine navigating the bustling streets of New York City, where every turn and signal is a microcosm of the city's dynamic life. Now, consider the complex task of analyzing the patterns and causes behind the traffic accidents that frequently disrupt this flow. What if we could mine through vast amounts of traffic data to uncover hidden patterns, predict future accidents, and propose measures to enhance road safety? This is not just a thought experiment but the core of this project on data mining New York City traffic accidents.


Our journey begins with a dive into the extensive datasets of NYC traffic accidents, where each record is not just a statistic but a story waiting to be understood. What if we could identify the most dangerous times of day or the riskiest intersections using data mining techniques? How might this knowledge transform our approach to urban planning and personal daily commuting?
