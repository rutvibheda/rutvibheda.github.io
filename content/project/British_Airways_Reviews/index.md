Developed an advanced Tableau dashboard featuring interactive visualizations and geographical mapping to analyze customer reviews of British Airways. This comprehensive tool is designed to track and monitor key performance metrics (KPIs), providing stakeholders with actionable insights. The dashboard integrates data from various sources to present a holistic view of customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Through interactive elements, users can drill down into specific data points, such as flight routes, services, and crew performance, to identify trends and areas needing attention. This enables data-driven decision-making, allowing British Airways to focus on targeted improvements and strategic planning.
