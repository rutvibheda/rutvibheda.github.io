Developed a comprehensive churn analysis dashboard designed to help stakeholders monitor and reduce customer attrition. The dashboard was built using SQL Server for efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, ensuring that the raw data collected from multiple sources was properly cleaned and prepared for analysis. This involved managing data quality by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistency across various customer-related fields such as demographics, usage patterns, and transaction histories. With a dataset comprising 6,418 customers, you ensured that the data was structured effectively, setting the foundation for meaningful insights.

The transformed data was then imported into Power BI, where further data transformations were applied, and insightful visualizations were created to analyze customer churn patterns. The dashboard provided a clear view of the overall churn rate of 27%, and allowed for an in-depth examination of customer demographics such as age, gender, geographic location, and service usage to identify trends and risk factors that correlated with higher churn. The visualizations, including key performance indicators (KPIs), bar charts, and interactive filters, made it easy for users to explore the data and gain actionable insights into customer behavior. This analysis enabled stakeholders to implement targeted strategies to improve customer retention by addressing the specific factors leading to churn.
