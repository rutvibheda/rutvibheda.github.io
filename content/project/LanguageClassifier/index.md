Developed a high-accuracy text classification model utilizing Decision Trees and the AdaBoost algorithm, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.48% in distinguishing between English and Dutch. The model leveraged the boosting capabilities of AdaBoost to enhance the performance of the Decision Trees, combining multiple weak learners into a strong learner. Extensive feature engineering was employed, training the model on a dataset with five distinct and carefully selected features. This diverse set of features significantly improved the model's ability to learn and generalize from the data, leading to highly effective language classification.

The model giving the best accuracy among the two was Decision Tree.
