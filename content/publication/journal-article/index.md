abstract: Throughout various fields worldwide, one crucial area is education. Technology has played a significant role in enhancing education, making learning more accessible and comprehensible for everyone. It has proven to be a valuable tool, facilitating teaching methods and improving efficiency by providing economical and effective ways to deliver digital content. Research indicates that Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have significant potential to benefit both students and teachers. For students, these technologies can boost productivity, while for teachers, they offer an opportunity to expand their teaching techniques. This makes the educational experience more engaging and effective. However, there is currently no platform specifically designed to allow non-skilled developers to easily create AR/VR content. Therefore, there is a need for new tools that enable users to effortlessly become creators of such experiences. This paper hence focuses primarily on education followed by the various use cases of augmented and virtual reality.
